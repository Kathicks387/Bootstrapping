                <p class="text-about">
                    After a succesful career in the field of education, I've decided to pursue a career in software development.  As the principal of a STEM school I purchased the Tynker Coding Pogram for our first through fifth grade students.  As I watch them grow in their knowledge and skils, I knew it was time for me to fulfill my desire to become a software developer.  With 100% certainty that this was the path I wanted to take, I enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp Program offered by Case Western Reserve University. The program was very challenging, but I learned a ton!
                </p>
                <p class="text-about">While attending bootcamp I gained knowledge, practice, and experience with using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars, NodeJs, Express, PWA, React, MySQL and Mongodb programming languages. You may view a few of the projects I created during class on my <a href="bootcampprojects.html" class="pages">Bootcamp Portfolio</a> page. Group projects afforded me the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of Github.  Team projects completed during bootcamp may be found on my <a href="bootcampgroupprojects.html" class="pages">Bootcamp Group Projects</a> page.  
                </p>

                     Since completing the program I have gained more experience and practice in utilizing my new found skills.  I wanted to understand JavaScript more deeply so I found and completed two courses on Udemy to help me do so.  These two courses, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/" class="pages">Modern JavaScript Complete guide, from Novice to Ninja</a> (by Shaun Pelling), and <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/?src=sac&kw=modern+javascript+from" class="pages">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning</a> (by Brad Traversy) helped to clarify many of the concepts I learned during bootcamp. I've also purchased several other programs as I continue to learn and practice my skills on a daily basis.
                </p>

                <p class="text-about"> My skills have definitely grown since concluding the program.  I've deployed a couple of websites that I am very proud of and I will continue to go back to improve them.  My github repository can be found at <a class="github pages" href="https://github.com/Kathicks387?tab=repositories" >https://github.com/Kathicks387.</a>  I look forward to learning more and more each day. I eagerly await the opportunity to apply all I have learned.
